Systems Programming under Linux
=======

Hello. Welcome to the Preface.


The book tries to cover the systems programming under linux based operating systems in **C**. The most of the part in this book is my personal experience with the programming in the systems level of the linux operating system. I am DevNaga, a software engineer.

This book is not for those who seek for kernel programming topics. This book deals with the layer above it, the system calls and middlewear.

Please open a ticket for a new feature request or topic addition or [email](<mailto:devendra.aaru@gmail.com>) me about it.
