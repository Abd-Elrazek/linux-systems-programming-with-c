Systems Programming under Linux
=======

Hello. Welcome to the Preface.


The book tries to cover the systems programming under linux based operating systems in **C**. The most of the part in this book is my personal experience with the programming in the systems level of the linux operating system. I am DevNaga. More about me below.

All the source code examples described in this book are self-contained and are compiled and ran on a linux operating system.

This book is not for those who seek for kernel programming topics. This book deals with the layer above it, the system calls and middlewear.

Almost all of the code samples are kept at [GitHub](https://github.com/DevNaga/gists.git). Please feel free to clone.

Please open a ticket for grammatical errors, a new feature request or topic addition. You can also [email](<mailto:devendra.aaru@gmail.com>) me about it.
