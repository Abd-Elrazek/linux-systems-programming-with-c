## Version control systems
###Git

1.  Git is very powerful version control system.
2.  Created by Linus Torvalds, also the creator of Linux Operating system.
3.  Git allows versioning of a file or set of files into a group called repository stored somewhere in the server.
4.  Git can also be thought of as a time travel system to go back in time to find the versions of the file or set of files that are good / bad and find what changed and who changed it. Also allows going back to the older or last good set of files.
5.  In most cases Git is used to maintain the code. In many other cases even the documents.
6.  This very book is written on a platform that uses the Git as one of its backend.
7.  installation of the git:

    on Ubuntu:
    
        sudo apt-get install git-all
